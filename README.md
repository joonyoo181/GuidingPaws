## GuidingPaws
Having family members with failing vision, we were inspired to create GuidingPaws to empower visually impaired individuals with an accessible solution - a phone app. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the app uses a smartphone camera to detect and announce nearby obstacles, providing real-time guidance for the visually impaired. We hope that the app can not only assist others in navigating a world of obstacles, but also provide users with the independence and confidence to explore - just like a service dog!

## Challenges
We tested quite a few different object recognition machine learning models to determine the highest-accuracy classification results, ultimately aiming to maximize safety for users. While this app will not be able to replace the diligent work of service dogs, we hope that this can act as a viable and convenient alternative.

## Future Goals
In the future, we hope to make GuidingPaws more language-inclusive by providing text-to-speech options in multiple languages, and add gentle physical cues, like phone vibrations, to help those with hearing impairments.
